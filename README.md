# SHEILAN's Maya Tools
Here's a small Maya plugin featuring every script I ever made for the program mostly to automate long and annoying jobs.
All codes are made to make your life easier, so if something is bothering you, let me know and I shall fix it.


## Features

### COD
* Load FULL maps exported with Husky ([updated version](https://github.com/sheilan102/husky_modified)).
* Combine separated body models into one, fullbody skeleton (supporting only BO4 currently).



## Installation & Usage

Download all .py files and place them in -

**64 Bit** `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2018\bin\plug-ins`

**32 Bit** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Maya2018\bin\plug-ins`

Launch Maya, go to `Window->Settings/Preferences->Plugin Manager`, look for `SHEILAN's Tools.py` and enable it.


#### Map Importer

Select MAP Folder (Husky export with all map data)

Select Greyhound's XModel directory (**e.g. `..\Greyhound\exported_files\black_ops_2\xmodels`**

> **MAKE SURE YOU EXPORTED MAP MODELS FIRST**
